# Master-Po-Shen-Loh-s-New-Method-of-Solving-Quadratics
As seen here, https://www.poshenloh.com/quadraticdetail/ Master Po discovered a simplier way to solve quadratics so I figured I'd implement it in Python

It's a newly discovered way of solving quadratic functions without even guessing the b and c,
plus it's way faster and less confusing than the quadratic equation. 


Just for the heck of it, I decided to translate Master Po's method into python :)
